It's almost been a month now since my Grandma passed away. I've always considered myself close to my Grandparents or at least more so than some of my American friends. I grew up with them for a large portion of my childhood. My grandma often was the one who prepared dinner for our family. Despite all of this time, I would say that I didn't really *know* them.
