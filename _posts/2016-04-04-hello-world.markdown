### Hello. This is the first post of what will hopefully be many more - or at least a few more. 
I've decided to build a personal blog using Jekyll just to have another side project and because I think there is some value in keeping a journal. Especially a digital one in which you could search and browse through as easy as navigating a website. Building a journal from scratch intrigued me as it allows me to keep all of this data to myself without using existing journaling tech companies such as Medium or Day One.  Plus, Jekyll seems cool.

When I was little, I used to love keeping journals. I've always loved the concept of personal data and have always enjoyed exploring nostalgia. I hope with the personal investment of building this site, I will be better about updating it.
